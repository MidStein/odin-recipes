    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is one of my favorite dishes of all time even though it does not have much to it.
        I still get to eat it whenever I visit my parent's home and the habit of rolling the bread
        and stirring it in the milk and thus causing a mess has still not left me as an adult.
        This is highly recommended by me if you are hungry and do not want to go through the effort
        of making a recipe which takes more effort.
    </p>
    <p>This dish combines the balanced nutrition of milk and the crunchy and solid quality
        of bread slices which makes it an enjoyable and at the same time nutritional substite
        for a children's meal occasionaly or in case the time is short. Since there are a very
        steps required to prepare this food, it can also be taught to children which parents
        will find very rewarding for both them and their children.
